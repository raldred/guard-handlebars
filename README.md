# Guard::Handlebars

Guard::Handlebars compiles your Handlebars automatically when files are modified.

Tested on MRI Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2 and the latest versions of JRuby & Rubinius.

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continue.

Install the gem:

    gem install guard-handlebars

Add it to your `Gemfile`, preferably inside the development group:

    gem 'guard-handlebars'

Add guard definition to your `Guardfile` by running this command:

    guard init handlebars

## Usage

Please read the [Guard usage documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

## Guardfile

Guard::Handlebars can be adapted to all kind of projects. Please read the
[Guard documentation](https://github.com/guard/guard#readme) for more information about the Guardfile DSL.

In addition to the standard configuration, this Guard has a short notation for configure projects with a single input a output
directory. This notation creates a watcher from the `:input` parameter that matches all Handlebars files under the given directory
and you don't have to specify a watch regular expression.

### Standard ruby gem

    guard 'handlebars', :input => 'handlebars', :output => 'javascripts'

### Rails app

    guard 'handlebars', :input => 'app/views', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'

## Options

There following options can be passed to Guard::Handlebars:

    :input => 'handlebars'              # Relative path to the input directory, default: nil
    :output => 'javascripts'            # Relative path to the output directory, default: nil
    :bare => true                       # Compile without the top-level function wrapper, default: false
    :shallow => true                    # Do not create nested output directories, default: false
    :hide_success => true               # Disable successful compilation messages, default: false
    :emberjs => true                    # Populate Ember.TEMPLATES[], default: false
    :all_on_start => true               # Regenerate all files on startup

### Nested directories

The guard detects by default nested directories and creates these within the output directory. The detection is based on the match
of the watch regular expression:

A file

    /app/views/mycontroller/myview.handlebars

that has been detected by the watch

    watch(%r{app/views/(.+\.handlebars)})

with an output directory of

    :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'

will be compiled to

    public/javascripts/compiled/mycontroller/myview.js

Note the parenthesis around the `.+\.handlebars`. This enables Guard::Handlebars to place the full path that was matched inside the
parenthesis into the proper output directory.

This behavior can be switched off by passing the option `:shallow => true` to the guard, so that all JavaScripts will be compiled
directly to the output directory.

### Multiple source directories

The Guard short notation

    guard 'handlebars', :input => 'app/views', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled'

will be internally converted into the standard notation by adding `(.+\.handlebars)` to the `input` option string and create a Watcher
that is equivalent to:

    guard 'handlebars', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
      watch(%r{app/views/(.+\.handlebars)})
    end

To add a second source directory that will be compiled to the same output directory, just add another watcher:

    guard 'handlebars', :input => 'app/views', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
      watch(%r{lib/views/(.+\.handlebars)})
    end

which is equivalent to:

    guard 'handlebars', :output => 'public/javascripts/compiled' do
      watch(%r{app/views/(.+\.handlebars)})
      watch(%r{lib/handlebars/(.+\.handlebars)})
    end

 ## Acknowledgment

I took the [Guard::CoffeeScript](https://github.com/netzpirat/guard-coffeescript) code base and renamed
stuff as a first pass. It helped me to learn Guard, and was pretty much what I wanted to be doing. I love
open source software!!

The [Guard Team](https://github.com/guard/guard/contributors) for giving us such a nice pice of software
that is so easy to extend, one *has* to make a plugin for it!

All the authors of the numerous [Guards](https://github.com/guard) available for making the Guard ecosystem
so much growing and comprehensive.
